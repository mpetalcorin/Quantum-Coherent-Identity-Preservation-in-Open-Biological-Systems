# Quantum-Coherent-Identity-Preservation-in-Open-Biological-Systems
This repository contains all code, simulations, datasets, and machine learning models used in the study “Quantum-Coherent Framework for Substrate-Invariant Identity in Open Biological Systems.” The project introduces a sustained-coherence master equation, a correlation-based identity functional, and a many-body mass-scaling model to explore coherence preservation, substrate-invariant identity, and collective tunneling in biological systems.

## Project Overview

This project provides a complete simulation and machine-learning analysis pipeline for studying how biological systems could maintain:

	•	long-lived coherence despite environmental noise, 
	•	identity stability despite continuous molecular turnover, and
	•	collective tunneling behavior through sublinear effective mass scaling.

## We implement:
  • Sustained-Coherence Master Equation\
  • Identity Functional for Substrate-Invariant Correlation Structure\
  • Many-Body Mass Scaling $M_{\mathrm{eff}} = m N^{\alpha}$\
  • Tunneling Model $|\mathcal{A}| \propto \exp[-N^{\alpha/2}]$\
  • ML Regression to Estimate Coherence Exponent $α$\
  • ML Classification of Coherent vs Classical Regimes

## Key Concepts

**1. Sustaining Superoperator**

    A compensatory term: 
$\mathcal{S} = -\mathcal{D}$ cancels decoherence in the Lindblad equation, stabilizing pure-state evolution even in open systems.

**2. Identity Functional**

    A relational measurement of identity:
$\mathbb{I}[\rho] = \sum_{k,\ell} \left| \langle O_k O_\ell \rangle \right|$
    remains invariant under full substrate replacement.

**3. Sublinear Mass Scaling**

    Coherent ensembles exhibit:
$M_{\mathrm{eff}} = m N^\alpha \quad (0 < \alpha < 1)$
    allowing enhanced collective tunneling.

**4. ML Interpretability**

    ML models recover the hidden coherence parameters from simulated observables.

## Datasheet for the Dataset

The following datasheet follows the Gebru et al. (2018) standard for dataset transparency.

**1. Motivation**

The datasets simulate coherence, identity patterns, mass scaling, and tunneling in open quantum biological systems to evaluate sustained coherence and relational identity.

	•	8,000 ML regression feature rows
	•	8,000 ML classification rows

No personal data, biological sequences, clinical records, or human subjects are included.

**3. Collection Process**

All data were generated by deterministic or stochastic simulation scripts under controlled random seeds.

**4. Preprocessing**
   
	•	Normalization
	•	Noise injection
	•	Correlation extraction
	•	Feature engineering (entropy slope, purity curvature, correlation texture)

**5. Uses**
   
	•	Teaching
	•	Testing quantum-like biological models
	•	Benchmarking ML methods on synthetic physics datasets
	•	Reproducible scientific analysis

**6. Restrictions**

No restrictions; CC BY 4.0.

## Model Card

This Model Card follows Mitchell et al. (2019).

**1. Model Overview**

Two ML models are trained:\
	1.	Random Forest Regressor: predicts the coherence exponent α.\
	2.	Random Forest Classifier: decides whether a sample belongs to coherent or classical dynamics.

**2. Intended Use**
	
  •	Interpret synthetic trajectories\
	•	Explore coherence regimes\
	•	Enable experimental inference from spectroscopy or spin-chemistry

**3. Out-of-Scope Uses**
	
  •	Biomedical diagnosis\
	•	Clinical decision making\
	•	Inferring identity from real organisms

**4. Training Data**

All data synthetic; no sensitive information.

**5. Metrics**
	
  •	Regression: R² ≈ 0.88\
	•	Classification: Accuracy ≈ 98%, high precision–recall

**6. Limitations**
	
  •	Reflects assumptions of theoretical models\
	•	Cannot validate coherence in vivo without experimental data\
	•	Sensitive to simulation quality and noise model

**7. Ethical Considerations**

No human data; minimal ethical risk.

**8. Application**

  •	Foundational cognitive science, theoretical neuroscience, memory models.\
This framework is relevant because it offers a mathematically coherent way to understand how living systems remain stable, coordinated, and identity-preserving despite constant molecular change, and shows how these principles can be applied to biological physics, synthetic biology, and quantum technologies.
